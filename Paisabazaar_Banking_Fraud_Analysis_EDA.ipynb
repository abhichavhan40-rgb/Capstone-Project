        "Paisabazaar is a financial services company that assists customers in finding and applying for various banking and credit products. An integral part of their service is assessing the creditworthiness of individuals, which is crucial for both loan approval and risk management. The credit score of a person is a significant metric used by financial institutions to determine the likelihood that an individual will repay their loans or credit balances. Accurate classification of credit scores can help Paisabazaar enhance their credit assessment processes, reduce the risk of loan defaults, and offer personalized financial advice to their customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this context, analyzing and classifying credit scores based on customer data can improve decision-making processes and contribute to better financial product recommendations. This case study aims to develop a model that predicts the credit score of individuals based on various features, such as income, credit card usage, and payment behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project *“Paisabazaar Banking Fraud Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)”* focuses on analyzing customer banking and credit-related data to identify patterns, anomalies, and risk indicators that may contribute to fraud or poor credit behavior. The dataset consists of multiple financial attributes such as annual income, outstanding debt, EMI, credit utilization ratio, delayed payments, payment behavior, and credit score categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first stage of the project involved **data cleaning and preprocessing**. Missing values in numerical features were imputed with medians, while categorical values were filled with the most frequent mode. Columns with more than 40% missing values were dropped to improve dataset reliability. Duplicate records were identified and removed to maintain data integrity. Derived features such as *Debt-to-Income Ratio* and *EMI-to-Salary Ratio* were created to capture deeper financial insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the **exploratory data analysis phase**, descriptive statistics and visualization techniques were applied to understand the distribution of key variables. The analysis revealed that customers with poor credit scores generally had high outstanding debt, greater credit utilization, frequent delayed payments, and higher EMI-to-salary ratios. Occupation and payment behavior also emerged as significant factors influencing credit risk. Correlation analysis highlighted strong relationships between utilization ratios, delayed payments, and poor credit performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project also examined **fraud risk indicators**, including unusually high numbers of credit inquiries, missed minimum payments, and negative monthly balances. These behaviors were strongly linked to higher default probability. Occupation categories such as self-employed individuals were observed to carry relatively higher risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final stage summarized key **insights and recommendations** for financial institutions. Monitoring high-risk indicators such as delayed payments, excessive debt burden, and frequent loan inquiries can help Paisabazaar and partner banks in early detection of potential fraud or defaults. This analysis not only enhances credit risk profiling but also assists in building a robust fraud detection and prevention framework.\n",

        "The increasing adoption of digital banking and credit services has also led to a significant rise in **financial frauds and credit risks**. Institutions like Paisabazaar, which act as intermediaries between customers and banks, face the challenge of **identifying high-risk customers** before loan approval or credit issuance. Traditional methods of credit evaluation often fail to capture hidden risk factors such as **delayed payments, excessive debt, high EMI burden, and poor payment behavior**, which may ultimately result in **fraudulent activities or defaults**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The absence of a systematic approach to analyze customer financial patterns leads to **inefficient credit decisions**, increasing the chances of non-performing assets (NPAs) and financial losses. Additionally, certain anomalies in customer behavior, like **frequent loan inquiries, irregular repayment trends, and high credit utilization ratios**, remain undetected without detailed exploratory analysis.\n",
